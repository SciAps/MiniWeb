MiniWeb
==========

MiniWeb is a Http server library written in Java targeted for embedded projects. MiniWeb's goals are to be small
and lightweight as possible while providing simple and easy to use API. MiniWeb uses the very mature and robust
[Apache HttpComponents](http://hc.apache.org) at its core.
